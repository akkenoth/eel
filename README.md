# EEL
Modern OpenGL (3+) sample program.

For now it displays a rotating sphere with 2 materials and a normal map applied, 2 sources of light (white - 'sun' and red - red sphere) and a skybox.
Finally it should display a (very simplified) 3D eel.

## Main features
* Working in OpenGL 3.3 Core profile
* Most computations happen in shaders (almost zero CPU usage)
* Improved Blinn-Phong attenuated shading model
* Normal mapping
* N light sources per scene, M materials per object (with alpha-blending - it's possible to apply a non-specular material on a very glossy one)
* Modular/OOP design

## Controls
* WSAD for camera movement
* Mouse for camera rotation (when enabled - see below)
* F to toggle fullscreen
* M to toggle mouse capture (disabled on startup)

## Requirements
* OpenGL 3.3 capable graphic card, e.g. Intel HD Graphics 3000 (Intel Core 2nd gen CPUs), NVidia GeForce 8 series, ATI/AMD Radeon HD 2000 series and newer
* C++11 compatible compiler (tested on modern GCC and VC++)
* For non-Windows OS: installed OpenGL, GLUT, GLEW, zlib and libpng libraries (Windows headers and pre-compiled .lib files are included)

## Compilation & running the program
* Preparation: put your textures in eel/Resources/* and/or adjust paths in main.cpp (some textures, generated by me in GIMP, are present but some aren't there due to copyright reasons)
* Windows: use eel.snl Visual Studio solution file or eel/eel.vcxproj project file (open with VS or import to your IDE of choice). Build and run.
* Linux/*nix: use provided Makefile (`make` or `make run` should be enough).

## Known issues:
* Execution caveat: hardcoded relative paths to textures (in main.cpp). Run from 'eel' directory (with Resources directory in it - see Makefile) or modify the paths (or change the way they're passed).
* Mouse capture may not be working in MacOS (GLUT limitations; should work with up-to-date GLUT though)
